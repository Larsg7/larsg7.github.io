# About me

Hi, my name is Lars Gr√∂ber, I am currently a student at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. Working at the student project *PhysikOnline* has enabled me to learn a lot about (web-)development, server-architecture and linux in general.

As a supporter of F.O.S.S. (Free and Open-Source Software) and everyday linux user I want to share some knowledge in small posts which I will post every sometimes (credit goes to [whaitbutwhy](http://waitbutwhy.com) for that wording). 

For more information about my work head over to my [Github](https://github.com/larsg7).
